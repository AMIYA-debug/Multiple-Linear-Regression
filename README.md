# Multiple Linear Regression – California Housing Dataset

This project implements a Multiple Linear Regression model using Python and scikit-learn to predict housing prices in California based on various features such as income, population, and location characteristics.

## Dataset

- **Source**: `sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing`
- **Features**:
  - MedInc: Median income in block group
  - HouseAge: Median house age in block group
  - AveRooms: Average number of rooms
  - AveBedrms: Average number of bedrooms
  - Population: Block group population
  - AveOccup: Average house occupancy
  - Latitude & Longitude: Block group coordinates

## What This Project Does

- Loads the California housing dataset using `scikit-learn`
- Performs basic data exploration and visualization
- Builds a Multiple Linear Regression model
- Evaluates the model using R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Predicts housing prices based on multiple features

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
